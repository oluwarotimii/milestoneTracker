This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

Description of this app and explantion for design choices

# Getting Started

>**Note**:  This app is a Baby's milestone Tracker App for mohters to track the  growth of their chidren, (babies) as they grow older this app will help record events and important occasisons in the lifes of the younger ones

## Architeture

This app was built in the follwing sequece, first made sure it was possbile to create profiles, this is for the babies ad people have multiple babies, then  each profile is assigned an ID now when creating a milestone,  each milestoneis tied to a  baby profile. while creating the baby profile one can include the baby's weight, gender and also choose  an avatar.

## TECH STACK
Firstly this project was built with React-Native. using the JSX syntax.
Now going further I used the Async Storage to manage the local storage for the app data like profiles, milestone, 


## Explanation
Starting with the onboaring, I used a flatList to make the carouseel,  from there the user navigates to the Home Screen, I implemeted a simple greeting function   that changes the greeting with the time of day. 
Now for the  navigation I used the react navigation I used the stack and Bottom Tab bar navigation, it contains three screens the button  in the middle is for creating the mileston, the Home screen displays a carousel of the baby profiles available and  underneath a  button to  create more profile this is where one ca select an avatar and put in the Name and date if birth gender and all other details, I used hooks uSeState and useEffect alot in  this project mostly for the state management.

The colors I chose were orange and white, and the color of my illustrations formy onboarding were darker and closer to the asphalt colors
 Now in the middle button the Botto Tab bar take the user to a page to sekect a profile, this is to create a mislestone perculiar to a baby n the case they have multiple profiles, anad the last Tab is to list the  Milestones avaivalbele on the app all in one pplace with  the avatars and names of the profile the milestone belongs to infront of it. In this project I iused the Vector Icons

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
